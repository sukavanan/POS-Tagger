# POS Tagging using Greedy and Viterbi Decoding.

The pos_tagger_notebook contains a simple tutorial on the flow of preprocessing a given dataset and applying the greedy and viterbi decoding alogrithms to predict the POS tags of each word in the given dataset.

On comparing the results of both the algorithms it is evident that Viterbi decoding out-performs the Greedy decoding algorithm.

You could run the .py file, which uses a pre-trained hmm model, to create prediction files for the given inputs.
